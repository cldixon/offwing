/**
 * The activity feed, the live stream, and the synthetic generator behind them.

 * a test can hold honest:
 *
 *   - the feed is ordered on the observer's clock, not on anything an issuer
 *     wrote down, so a backdated certificate cannot choose where it appears;
 *   - the stream renders the same card the page does, so a streamed event and
 *     a reloaded one cannot drift apart;
 *   - the generator writes nothing while nobody is watching, because every
 *     event it produces is a permanent write to a real repository.
