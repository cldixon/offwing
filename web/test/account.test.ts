/**
 * Account pages: one organization's repository, drawn as a profile.
 *
 * The claims worth holding honest here are not about layout.
 *
 *   - Both tabs exist because a repository holds two kinds of record, and
 *     eleven of the twenty-nine organizations in this demonstration issue
 *     nothing at all. A profile that showed only releases would tell a reader
 *     that every operator, broker and lessor does nothing.
 *   - The counts are arithmetic over this observer's index, and one of them
 *     used to be able to exceed the total it is shown against.
 *   - A handle and a DID address the same account, because the links in this
 *     application are built from handles and the records only carry DIDs.
 *   - Nothing on the page is a verdict, and the page says out loud that the
 *     profile is self-asserted.
