 * Runtime configuration, resolved from the environment with defaults chosen so
 * that a service deployed with *no* variables at all still comes up correct.
 *
 * That property is not a nicety. Recreating a Railway service silently drops
 * every variable it had, and the first time that happened here the app booted
 * green, served every page, and failed every verification — because it was
 * pointed at the real network with no PDS behind it. A deployment that is
 * broken but looks healthy is worse than one that refuses to start, so the
 * zero-configuration case is now the demonstrable default rather than an
 * accident.
