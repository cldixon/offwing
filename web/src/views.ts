 * the handle column when it could not resolve one, so an unguarded fallback
 * trades one rendering of a DID for a longer one and looks, from outside,
 * exactly like the bug it was meant to fix.
 *
 * Three copies of this logic existed and they disagreed: the parts page fell
 * back to the handle, the feed and the thread page went straight to the DID.
 * That is why a receiver rendered as an identifier on one screen and a name on
