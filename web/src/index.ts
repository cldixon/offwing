/**
 * Server bootstrap.
 *
 * Three deliberate properties. Verification works with no database — losing the
 * index degrades browsing, not the service's primary job. With no PDS
 * configured the app boots against an in-memory network preloaded with the demo
 * scenario, so the whole thing runs from a fresh clone with nothing installed
 * but Node. And a deployment carrying no environment variables at all comes up
 * in that same working state rather than in a broken-but-green one.
